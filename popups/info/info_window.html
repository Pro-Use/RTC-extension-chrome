                Search Engine Artist and Internet Imperialist <strong>Gretchen Andrew</strong>, best known for her playful hacks on major art world institutions, unveils a new series of work that actively reprograms the artificial intelligence underlying the global internet. These new works, referred to as “vision boards,” appear as top search results through her unique process of using the failures of the internet to make her own dreams come true. AI is inherently backward-looking and susceptible to being reprogrammed through knowledge of the internet’s structure, and Gretchen exploits this by rewriting existing representations of reality by using a search engine’s own rules and limitations against itself

                <strong>Sofia Crespo’s Artificial Remnants</strong> is an ongoing exploration of artificial life using machine learning to generate new insectile species from real-world datasets. Questioning how we engage with the rich diversity of the natural world in virtual, digital space, the work celebrates natural diversity of insectile life in the form of creating new specimens that are digital natives. The work addresses the vulnerability of non-human species and the need for mapping them, and archiving them, before it’s too late.

                In <strong>Zizi, Jake Elwes</strong> presents a procession of faces of drag artists in constant transition generated from data using machine learning. Drag is a queer performance form that celebrates and challenges gender and otherness and Zizi’s gender, identity, race, whether they are real or artificial, is all uncertain. The work tackles the lack of representation in datasets often used by facial recognition systems, and disrupts these systems by retraining them with the addition of drag and gender fluidity. This causes the weights in the neural network to shift away from the normative identities it was originally trained on. Here the constraints around representation are lifted, celebrating difference and ambiguity within bodies as well as questioning bias in our data driven society.

                <strong>DISNOVATION’s Predictive Art Bot</strong> generates new concepts for artworks based on current media discourse from diverse fields including politics, environment, culture and health. The bot is powered by an algorithm that identifies and combines keywords to come up with  concepts for artworks in a fully automated fashion. These concepts range in style from the prophetic to the absurd, encouraging unusual associations of ideas and breaking through echo chambers by automating the human creative process.

                <strong>Ben Grosser’s</strong> work <strong>Tracing You</strong> presents a website’s best attempt to see the world from its visitors’ viewpoints. By cross referencing visitor IP addresses with available online data sources, the system traces each visitor back through the network to its possible origin. The end of that trace is the closest available image that potentially shows the visitor’s physical environment. Tracing You provokes questions surrounding accuracy of data sources, the locality of visitors and how a computational system analyzes this, why that system might want to “see” a visitors environment, and about who (or what) is reading the web

                In <strong>Libby Heaney’s Elvis</strong>, we are presented with the current possibilities of deepfake technologies, which the artist employs here to portray herself as Elvis and Elvis as herself. At first glance, we assume that the screens show the original Elvis, but as we look closely we recognise some of Libby’s features. These portraits present a non-binary Elvis, imagining the singer as a womxn. The artist explores the nature of gender, performativity and consumption through digital technologies, as well as subverting the notions of the male genius.

                With <strong>GANbreeder, Joel Simon</strong> enables the audience to take part in making AI art collaboratively in real-time. The tool allows users to pick images as ‘parents’ from which new images are generated. These can then be shared so that others can use them to make further images. GANbreeder explores the notions of authorship, creativity and collaboration through a straightforward interface that is designed to enable anyone to contribute, enrich and promote the art breeding mechanism and its associated community.
